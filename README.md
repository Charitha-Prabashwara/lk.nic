LK.NIC (Srl Lanka National Identity Card). This is a front-end library. Reading the information encoded in Sri Lanka's national identity card number (date of birth, gender, citizenship, or foreignness) and identity card number verification can be easily done using this library.

## Description

No matter how much technology is developed in the world, there are hardly any libraries created for the creation of general applications in Sri Lanka. Therefore, software developers have to face many difficulties. To provide services to Sri Lankans living,  abroad and the internal needs of Sri Lanka, it is essential to verify their National Identity Card number and obtain the data encoded in that number when they enter their National Identity Card number in the software applications.

Most of the services run as Web systems. Therefore, it is essential to verify the data entered by the users. It is essential to detect errors made by users while entering data. To do this, it is very important to develop a library that suits the needs of Sri Lanka. It can increase the time and productivity of software developers.The creation of '**Libraries**' for national needs is a strength to encourage Developers and Students, to create new systems.

You can use "**lknic**" to easily verify your 'National ID' number, retrieve coded information, and perform calculations using ID numbers.
